# Deploying & Running

A step-by-step guide to deploy the `KeeperRegistry` to Stellar testnet and run a
keeper bot against it.

## Prerequisites

- Rust with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:
  ```bash
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```
- The [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/stellar-cli)
  (`stellar`), formerly `soroban`.
- Node.js ≥ 18 (for the keeper bot).

## 1. Build the contract

```bash
make wasm        # or: ./scripts/optimize.sh
```

This produces `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/keeper_registry.wasm`.

## 2. Create and fund a testnet identity

```bash
stellar keys generate deployer --network testnet
stellar keys fund deployer --network testnet
```

## 3. Deploy and Initialize with `skn deploy` (Recommended)

The `skn` CLI (`packages/cli`) uploads WASM, deploys, initializes, and writes
the deployed contract IDs directly to your selected profile in
`~/.config/skn/skn.config.json`. It prints every initialization parameter for
confirmation before submitting and refuses mainnet deployments without
`--confirm-mainnet`.

```bash
# Initialize default profiles (testnet, futurenet, mainnet) if you have not yet:
skn config init

# Deploy and initialize KeeperRegistry on testnet (saves contractId to profile):
skn deploy registry \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/keeper_registry.wasm \
  --identity deployer \
  --profile testnet \
  --fee-bps 300

# Deploy and initialize Treasury on testnet (saves treasuryContractId to profile):
skn deploy treasury \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/keeper_treasury.wasm \
  --identity deployer \
  --profile testnet

# Or deploy and initialize both in one step:
skn deploy all \
  --registry-wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/keeper_registry.wasm \
  --treasury-wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/keeper_treasury.wasm \
  --identity deployer \
  --profile testnet
```

For mainnet, pass `--network mainnet --confirm-mainnet` explicitly.

## 4. Deploy and Initialize Manually with `stellar` CLI

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/keeper_registry.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet
# → prints the deployed CONTRACT_ID (C...)
```

> The repo also ships `scripts/deploy.sh` which wraps these steps.

Pick a reward token — on testnet you can use the native XLM SAC address from
`stellar contract id asset --asset native --network testnet`.

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> --source deployer --network testnet -- \
  initialize \
  --admin <DEPLOYER_ADDRESS> \
  --reward_token <TOKEN_SAC_ADDRESS> \
  --fee_bps 300
```

## 5. Register a task (as a dApp)

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> --source deployer --network testnet -- \
  register_task \
  --owner <OWNER_ADDRESS> \
  --task_type Liquidation \
  --calldata <HEX_BYTES> \
  --reward 1000000 \
  --deadline <UNIX_TS> \
  --ttl_ledgers 17280 \
  --lock_ledgers 120
```

## 6. Run the keeper bot

The bot can be run as a long-running daemon or as a one-shot process via cron.

### Daemon mode

This is the default. The bot will poll for tasks every `POLL_INTERVAL_MS`.

```bash
cd examples/keeper-bot
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: KEEPER_SECRET_KEY, REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID, NETWORK=testnet
npm install
npm start
```

The bot polls for `TaskRegistered` events, claims claimable tasks, executes them
off-chain, submits proof via `execute_task`, and periodically withdraws accrued
rewards. It also expires past-deadline tasks (`EXPIRE_STALE_TASKS=true`) to
refund owners. See the header of `examples/keeper-bot/index.js` for tuning knobs
(`POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, `MAX_RETRIES`, `WITHDRAW_THRESHOLD`, …).

### Cron mode

For serverless or cron-based deployments, use the `--once` flag or the
`RUN_ONCE=true` environment variable. The bot will run one round and exit with a
status code indicating success (0) or failure (non-zero).

**Example crontab (runs every minute):**

```crontab
# /etc/cron.d/keeper-bot
* * * * * your-user /path/to/soroban-keeper-network/examples/keeper-bot/run.sh >> /var/log/keeper-bot.log 2>&1
```

You'll need a wrapper script like `run.sh` to `cd` into the right directory
and invoke `node`.

**`run.sh`**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
cd /path/to/soroban-keeper-network/examples/keeper-bot
/usr/bin/node index.js --once
```

This setup ensures that even if one run fails, the next minute's run will try
again, providing resilience without requiring a long-lived process.

## Reproducing a release hash locally

The release WASM is **reproducible** — the GitHub release includes a sha256
that you can verify by building the contract locally from the same tagged commit.
This proves that the published binary corresponds to the tagged source code and
hasn't been altered.

### Prerequisites

- Rust `1.80.0` with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target (pinned in
  `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- binaryen `version_119` / wasm-opt (pinned in `.tool-versions`)
- git

### Steps

1. **Check out the release tag:**
   ```bash
   git checkout v0.2.0  # Replace with the version you want to verify
   ```

2. **Install the pinned Rust toolchain:**
   ```bash
   rustup update
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```
   The exact version is read from `rust-toolchain.toml` automatically by
   `rustup` and `cargo`. You should see Rust 1.82.0 when you run `cargo build`.

3. **Install wasm-opt (binaryen):**
   ```bash
   VERSION=$(grep '^binaryen ' .tool-versions | cut -d' ' -f2)
   curl -sSL "https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/releases/download/${VERSION}/binaryen-${VERSION}-x86_64-linux.tar.gz" \
     | tar -xz
   export PATH="$PWD/binaryen-${VERSION}/bin:$PATH"
   ```

4. **Build the contract:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --locked --release \
     --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
     --package keeper-registry
   ```

5. **Optimize the WASM:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p dist
   RAW=target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/keeper_registry.wasm
   wasm-opt -Oz --strip-debug \
     --enable-bulk-memory --enable-sign-ext --enable-mutable-globals \
     "$RAW" -o dist/keeper_registry.optimized.wasm
   ```

6. **Compute and compare the sha256:**
   ```bash
   sha256sum dist/keeper_registry.optimized.wasm
   ```
   Compare this output against the sha256 published on the GitHub release page.
   They must match exactly.

### If the hash doesn't match

This could indicate:

- **Wrong Rust version:** verify `rustc --version` shows `1.82.0`. If not,
  `rustup` may not have read `rust-toolchain.toml`. Try `rustup show` to
  confirm the override is active.
- **Wrong wasm-opt version:** verify the downloaded binaryen is `version_119`.
  Check `wasm-opt --version`.
- **Dirty working tree:** `cargo build` will include uncommitted changes. Run
  `git status` and ensure the checkout is clean.
- **Different checkout path:** absolute paths were deliberately suppressed via
  RUSTFLAGS (see below), but if you encounter differences, check that both
  builds used similar directory structures.
- **Different OS/architecture:** reproducibility is verified on `ubuntu-24.04`
  with `x86_64`. Builds on macOS or ARM may differ due to compiler or linker
  differences. Use the published CI hash as the source of truth.

### Troubleshooting with binary diffs

If hashes still differ, use `wasm2wat` to inspect the binaries:

```bash
# Install wasm2wat (comes with binaryen)
wasm2wat dist/keeper_registry.optimized.wasm > a.wat

# Download the published WASM from the GitHub release and compare
wasm2wat keeper_registry.optimized.wasm > b.wat
diff a.wat b.wat
```

This will show the first code or data difference. File a GitHub issue with
the diff and your environment details (OS, Rust version, binaryen version) so
the maintainers can investigate.

## Verifying a deployment

Add the contract to a block explorer link for your application:

```
https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/<CONTRACT_ID>
```

## Publishing the TypeScript SDK

`packages/sdk-ts` (`@soroban-keeper-network/sdk`) publishes to npm
independently of the contract's own `vX.Y.Z` releases above — it has its
own tag namespace and its own workflow
(`.github/workflows/sdk-ts-publish.yml`), so a contract release never
triggers an npm publish and an SDK publish never tags a contract release.

1. **Bump the version** in `packages/sdk-ts/package.json`.
2. **Commit and tag it** as `sdk-ts-v<version>`, matching the bumped
   version exactly — the workflow verifies this and fails the publish
   otherwise:
   ```sh
   git commit -am "chore(sdk-ts): bump to 0.2.0"
   git tag -a sdk-ts-v0.2.0 -m "sdk-ts v0.2.0"
   git push origin main sdk-ts-v0.2.0
   ```
3. The workflow runs on that tag push: installs, runs the full unit test
   suite and lint as a hard gate, builds, smoke-tests the built package
   by type-checking `examples/node-signing` against `dist/` (not
   source — this is what actually proves the published API works for a
   real consumer), then publishes with npm's
   [provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements)
   attached.
4. It never runs on an ordinary merge to `main` — only on a
   `sdk-ts-v*.*.*` tag push, or manually via `workflow_dispatch` for an
   existing tag.

**One-time setup for whoever configures repository secrets:** create an
npm [granular access
token](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens#creating-granular-access-tokens)
scoped to **only** the `@soroban-keeper-network/sdk` package with
publish permission (not a personal account token, and not one scoped to
the whole npm account/org) — automation tokens can also be restricted to
never expire without triggering npm's normal login re-auth prompts, but
prefer a token with an expiry you rotate over one that doesn't, and
revoke it immediately if this workflow or its secret is ever suspected
compromised. Add it as the `SDK_TS_NPM_TOKEN` secret on the repository's
`npm-publish` GitHub Environment (not a plain repository secret) so it's
protected by that environment's own review/approval rules.
